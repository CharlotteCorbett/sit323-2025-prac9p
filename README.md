## Containerised Calculator Microservice
This project is a containerised calculator that receives parameters via API calls then returns the result along with the HTTP status, via an Express server.
In this version, the containerised calculator is deployed to a locally hosted Kubernetes cluster.

### How To Build Calculator Microservice Image:
---
There are two options to build this service:
- Docker File (Dockerfile)
- Docker Compose file (docker-compose.yml)

### Building Image via Dockerfile:
To build the image via the Dockerfile, type in the following command in the terminal after logging into Docker:

`docker build . -t <desired_image_name>`

After Docker builds the image, you should see it on Docker Desktop.

Run the container using the following command:

`docker run <desired_image_name>`

### Building Image via Docker Compose:
To build the image via Docker Compose, open a terminal inside your version of this repo, then run the following command:

`docker compose up`

### How To Deploy the Calculator Microservice:
It is assumed that you have set up your own Kubernetes cluster to use, including the Kubernetes Dashboard UI.
I used the Docker Desktop Kubernetes cluster hosted locally on my machine.


After setting up the Kubernetes Dashboard UI, the container can be deployed via the following steps:

1. Push the image to a private DockerHub repository. 
2. Create the Kubernetes admin user and Assign Roles:
In the project terminal, type (individually):
`kube ctl apply -f dashboard-adminuser.yaml`
`kubectl apply -f cluster_role_binding.yaml`
3. Create a token to log into the Kubernetes Dashboard:
In the project terminal, type:
`kubectl -n kubernetes-dashboard create token admin-user`
Note: 'kubernetes-dashboard' is the name of the dashboard. If you gave your dashboard a different name, use the one you gave it.
4. Log into the Kubernetes Dashboard:
Copy the token the previous command generated and use that to log into the Dashboard.
5. Create a Pod
In the createPod.yaml file, change the `image:` field to the pushed image in your private repository. 
In the project terminal, type:
`kubectl apply -f createPod.yaml`
Go back to the Dashboard and notice that a Pod has been created. It should say what status it is.
6. Create a ReplicaSet
In the createReplicaSet.yaml file, change the `image:` field to the pushed image in your private repository
In the project terminal, type:
`kubectl apply -f createReplicaSet.yaml`
Go back to the Dashboard and notice that a ReplicaSet has been created. 
7. Create a Deployment
In the createDeployment.yaml file, change the `image:` field to the pushed image in your private repository
In the project terminal, type:
`kubectl apply -f createDeployment.yaml`
Go back to the Dashboard and notice that a Deployment has been created. 


### How To Access Calculator Microservice:
---
After building the image via one of the methods listed above, connect to the container using the following command:

`docker exec -it <container_name_or_id> <command>`

The "command" is the Curl HTTP request that will be sent to the Calculator Microservice API.

Eg: `curl -s http://localhost:3040/add/?n1=3&n2=4`

Note:

The container must be running in order to use this command. You can use the `docker ps` command to check whether the container is running, as well as get the container name/ID.

Alternatively, you can also run commands inside the container via Docker Desktop by the following steps:
1. Navigate to the Containers section (left side of screen)
2. Click the running container
3. Click the exec tab
4. Enter desired command, such as the example curl command listed above

With the deployment of the images, you should be able to use the Microservice in either the default image or any of the 2 replica sets specified in the pod.

Once in the container shell, you can then use the instructions below to interact with the Calculator Microservice as you please.


### How To Use Calculator Microservice:
---
- All required libraries have been installed and are included.
- Number validation is included to prevent crashes caused by invalid input.
- API requests can be posted using curl.
- API requests follow this format:
    http://localhost:port_number/service_name/?n1=value&n2=value


1. 

Upon running the image as a container, you should have already seen the following message:
    
    "Hello, I'm listening to port 3040
    You can see my results on Postman or at http://localhost:3040"

2. Using Curl, lodge a HTTP GET request to the API in the following format: 
    http://localhost:port_number/service_name/?n1=value1&n2=value2

### Calculator Services:
---
- Logger (logger)
- Add (/add)
- Subtract (/subtract)
- Multiply (/multiply)
- Divide (/divide)
- Modulus (/modulo)
- Exponentiation (/exponentiate)
- Minimum (/minimum)
- Maximum (maximum)
- Random Number between a Given Range (/randomrange)

### Logger (logger)
---

- Service that logs the result of each API call as well as the HTTP status of the request via the winston library in NodeJS.
- Runs on each request.
- Has no request methods.


### Add (/add)
---
Addition service that takes two parameters of numbers, adds them together, then returns the result along with the HTTP status.

Eg: HTTP GET http://localhost:3040/add/?n1=2&n2=2


### Subtract (/subtract)
---
Subtraction service that takes two parameters of numbers, subtracts them, then returns the result along with the HTTP status.

Eg: HTTP GET http://localhost:3040/subtract/?n1=2&n2=2

### Multiply (/multiply)
---
Multiplication service that takes two parameters of numbers, multiplies them, then returns the result along with the HTTP status.

Eg: HTTP GET http://localhost:3040/multiply/?n1=2&n2=2

### Divide (/divide)
---
Division service that takes two parameters of numbers, divides them, then returns the result along with the HTTP status.

Eg: HTTP GET http://localhost:3040/divide/?n1=2&n2=2

### Modulus (/modulo)
---
Modulus service that takes two parameters of numbers, performs a modulus operation, then returns the result along with the HTTP status.
